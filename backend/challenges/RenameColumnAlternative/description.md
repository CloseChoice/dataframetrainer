We make it pretty easy for you: Rename the `Value` column to `NewValue` and keep everything else as is.

<table>
<tr><th>Input </th><th>Output</th></tr>
<tr><td>

| Value |
| ----- |
| 1     |
| ...   |
| n     |

</td><td>

| NewValue |
| -------- |
| 1        |
| ...      |
| n        |

</td></tr> </table>
