Add a lower triangular matrix to the input dataframe. The lower triangular matrix
should have as many columns as the input dataframe has rows all labeled with `C{num}`
where `num` starts from 1 and increases up to `len(df)`. In the lower triangular of the additional frame, each entry should have the value of the index (hence the same as `num`).
