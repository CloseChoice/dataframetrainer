<h3>Welcome to Dataframetrainer</h3>
We are a website dedicated to help you improve your knowledge of the Python data science stack
entirely in the browser. You do not need to install anything, just register (or don't) and start learning.
We provide a variety of challenges and can help guide you through them if you are logged in 
BUT we never require you to do anything, you can just browse the challenges and solve them in whatever order you like.
<br>
<br>
<h4>What is a Challenge?</h4>
A challenge is a task that you have to solve using Python.
Tasks are usually transformations on pandas Datatrame or numpy arrays.
We have a range of challenges from easy to hard, but since this depends from person to person
we track the individual skill level of registered users and provide them with challenges
that are suitable for them.
<br>
<br>
<h4>How do I solve a Challenge?</h4>
Just have a look at the <i>Browse</i> bar at the top and click a challenge,
then you will be presented with a description of the challenge and a code editor.
The code editor is pre-filled with a template that you can use to solve the challenge.
You can run the code by clicking the <i>Run</i> button.
If you are confident that your solution is correct, click the <i>Test</i> button and wait a couple of seconds 
while we run a bunch of tests on your solution. If all tests pass, you solved the challenge,
if not try again or move on to another one.

<h4>Privacy Considerations</h4>
The site can be used without signing up. However we can provide a personalized learning experience only to 
signed in users. Signing up does not require any personal information, just a username and a password. Since we save
the passwords in a hashed format we cannot help you if you forget your password.
For logged in users we save every challenge they try and solve in order to improve our recommendation.
